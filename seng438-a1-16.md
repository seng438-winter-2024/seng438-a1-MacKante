# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Our exploratory test plan is to go through the system requirements found in Appendix B and check if each one functions properly. 
Tasks:
- Authentication:
    - Try using ATM before inserting card
    - Enter incorrect pins multiple times until card is permanently retained
- Transactions
    - After each transaction, check for accurate receipts
    - Make a withdrawal in multiples of 20 and try to make withdrawal not in multiples of 20
    - Try depositing with both cash and checks
    - Attempt money transfer between different accounts
    - Make balance inquiries on each linked account 
    - Abort a transaction in progress(maybe at different stages of the transaction)
    - Select deposit and wait for the timeout
- Operator
    - Turn switch to "on" and verify cash on hand
    - Try turning machine "off"
    - Try turning machine "off" while servicing customer
    - Use machine in "off" mode
- Logs
    - Check for PINs in logs
    - Verify two messages for deposits
    - Check start up and shut down messages
    - Verify message


# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory Testing:
    Approach:
        - Understand system requirements outlined in Appendix B
        - Create and follow an exploratory test plan
        - Make Changes to the test plan when needed

    Execution:
        - Carry out tests in test plan
        - Report defects as they are found in testing
        - Group review of all defects
    
Manual Scripted Testing
    Execution:
        - Perform testing as a group, one does tests, another keeps track of tests
        - Follow test suite outlined by Appendix C, execute each test at least once. Verifying actual results match expected results for each case.
        - Mark defects as MFT in the summary field to differentiate them from defects found during exploratory. This creates a list of newly added defect reports.
    
    Review:
        - After completing manual testing, the defect reports should now be reviewed.
        - The one who performed the previous test should be ,ain participant in reviewing the defect reports

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
